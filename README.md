1. Get yourself ATLauncher

2. Install it.

3. In the ATLauncher folder is a folder called Instances

4. Download this repo as zip, unzip into Instances

5. Rename the folder Gammelcraft-client to Gammelcraft

6. The directory should look like this: \Instances\Gammelcraft

7. Start ATLauncher, go to Instances tab

8. Start the pack.

9. (Optional) Download a Resource Pack.

10. I personally use Soartex Fanver Modded Universal 1.3.5 for 1.7.x (https://soartex.net/downloads/modpacks/)

11. Place the downloaded .zip into \Instances\Gammelcraft\resourcepacks (create the folder yourself if it's not there)

12. Have fun!
