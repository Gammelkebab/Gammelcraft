1. Get yourself ATLauncher

2. Install it.

3. In the ATLauncher folder is a folder called Instances

4. Download this repo as zip, unzip into Instances

5. Rename the folder Gammelcraft-client to Gammelcraft

6. The directory should look like this: \Instances\Gammelcraft

7. Start ATLauncher.

8. Go to the "Accounts"-tab in the launcher, add your Minecraft account (yes, non "Mojang-Accounts" from ancient times will still work).

9. Make sure your account is selected in the drop-down menu on the bottom of the launcher window.

10. go to Instances tab

11. Start the pack.

12. (Optional) Download a Resource Pack.

13. I personally use Soartex Fanver Modded Universal 1.3.5 for 1.7.x (https://soartex.net/downloads/modpacks/)

14. Place the downloaded .zip into \Instances\Gammelcraft\resourcepacks (create the folder yourself if it's not there)

15. Have fun!
